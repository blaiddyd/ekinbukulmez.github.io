            <div id="summ" class="container">
                <p>I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Western Australia. 
                I started programming in February 2018 and it has been my passion ever since.
                Besides university classes, I spend my most of time teaching myself about the wonderful world of Web Development.
                Before February 2018, I was an honours Global Business student at the University of Texas at Dallas in the United States.
                I lived in the US for 6 years, going to high school for 4 years, graduating as an International Baccalaureate(IB) student. I went on to study as a university student for 2 years afterwards.
                I was born in Ankara, Turkey and lived there for 13 years prior.
                <br><br>
                Besides programming, I play video games, especially League of Legends, 
                and rant about inaccurate depictions of Greek Mythology in pop culture.
                I'm also a huge fan of Korean pop music so I'm always open to talking about how amazing BTS and BLACKPINK are!

                    <p>I worked as a Web Development Intern at Mission Australia. I built the initial versions of the <a href="https://ekinbukulmez.github.io/NoWrongDoor/" target="_blank">No Wrong Door</a>
                        website, which allows for users to browse through help resources based on the users' age, needs, and suburb of choice. 
                        The website is built entirely out of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as it was meant to be a static website.
                        I am still working on the website to get it ready for official testing on a Volunteer developer basis.
                        I am currently focusing on rebuilding the website with Vue.js for efficiency and speed.
